# Stereokai

A color theme for **Xcode** based on the awesome [Monokai Revisited](https://github.com/halcyonmobile/xcode-monokai-revisited) theme.

Just made a couple of small changes, like the the selection color.

## Installation
To install any new Xcode color theme, just copy the `.xccolortheme` file to Xcode's FontAndColorThemes folder `(~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes/)` and restart Xcode. 
Then, in the Xcode menu, go to Preferences, then Fonts & Colors tab and select your desired theme.
